# CodingInterviewWorkshop
A bunch of problems to solve before a coding interview

Each python file has the problem description in comments at the top of the source file. Each problem has a unit test
associated with it. Once you complete the solution run the ruby test by running:

`python3 -m unittest tests/..._test.py`

For example:

`python3 -m unittest tests/message_decoder_test.py`

**Solutions to all problems can be found in the branch solutions**
