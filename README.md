# CodingInterviewWorkshop
A bunch of problems to solve before a coding interview.  
This projected has been tested with python3.

Each python file has the problem description in comments at the top of the source file. Each problem has a unit test
associated with it. Once you complete the solution run the ruby test by running:

`python3 -m unittest tests/..._test.py`

For example:

`python3 -m unittest tests/message_decoder_test.py`

**Solutions to all problems can be found in the branch solutions**

My own videos that might help solving these problems:  
* Generating mazes (helps with Sudoku puzzle): https://youtu.be/TJmPymF5Y_w
* Knuth shuffle: https://youtu.be/i8kD33wx9Mo
* Udemy course on Big O notation: https://www.udemy.com/course/big-o-notation-for-algorithms-in-plain-english/
