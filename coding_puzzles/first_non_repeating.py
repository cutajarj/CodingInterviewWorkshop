# A string might contain characters that repeat. In this coding puzzle the solution
# needs to return the first character that doesn't repeat.
#
# Given an input string, return the first character from the left, that appears only once
# If all the characters in the input repeat, the function should return an empty string
# The function should be case-sensitive.
# Assume only english characters and normal punctuation is used.
# Examples:
# "seashore" should return "a" because "s" and "e" repeat
# "systematisation systems" should return "o"
# "fudgefudge" should return "" since all the characters repeat
# "fudGefudge" should return "G"
